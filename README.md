# Candy Sales Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes sales data for Treat Link, a US-based candy distributor business, from 2021-2024. I created an interactive dashboard that helps business owners understand their sales performance, track profit margins, and make data-driven decisions about their candy products. The dashboard shows key business metrics and trends in an easy-to-understand visual format for this fictitious company scenario.

## Business Problem
Candy distributors like Treat Link need to understand which products are selling well, when sales peak, and how profitable their business is. This project answers important questions like:
- Which candy products make the most money?
- Are we hitting our sales targets across different divisions?
- What are our profit trends throughout the year?
- Which shipping methods do customers prefer?
- How do different product categories perform compared to each other?
